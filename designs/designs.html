                <h2>spotify case study</h2>
                <p>For this assignment, I had to find a pain point of an application and come up with a solution to that
                    pain point. Once I found the pain point, I had to conduct research to discover whether other users
                    of the application found the same pain point too. Once research was collected, I began to prototype
                    my fix using Adobe XD. The web page the case study is on was hand-coded by me using HTML and CSS. A
                    link to this case study can be found <a style="color: black; font-weight: bold;"

                <h2>connect</h2>
                <p>Connect aims to make connecting and networking with students, faculty, and alumni easier and more
                    fluid. Making connections and networking in college can help students understand their major better,
                    produce more effective work, and secure jobs after college. This process should be an easy one, but
                    there is not a one-stop-shop for all connecting needs. Some applications provide this service well,
                    but they lack settings that can help students narrow their search in finding meaningful connections
                    and networks. Connect gives the student those missing features. After planning, testing,
                    wireframing, and prototyping the Connect application, we have seen that our users not only find this
                    application easy to use, but they also find it invaluable in their connecting and networking
                    endeavors.</p>

                <p class="mt-5">I was tasked with designing a poster for a local documentary film festival called reel
                    change. By
                    using both image and typography I had to consider the overall message, and each element had
                    contribute to the main concept/message of the film festival. Because the documentaries focused on
                    change and new perspectives, I wanted to incorporate iconography that invoked insight (hence the
                    doorways). A closed outlook could now be opened, and new understandings and meanings can invoke
                    change.</p>

                    violations, the brand colors, the brand typefaces, and brand implementations of the logo. I created
                    the logo and logo implementations in Adobe Illustrator and created the Brand Guide in Adobe
